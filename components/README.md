> <b>Sebastian: </b>We use the meta tag <code>&lt;meta http-equiv="X-UA-Compatible" content="IE=edge"/&gt;</code> to tell Microsoft Internet Explorer to use the latest rendering engine (edge). This tag's result and value are to increase our code's compatibility with IE.
>
> We use the meta tag <code>&lt;meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width", initial-scale="1.0"&gt;</code> to give the browser instructions on how to control the page's dimensions and scaling. The <code>width=device-width</code> part sets the width of the page to follow the screen-width of the device (which will vary depending on the device). This tag's result and value are to enable us to perform responsive design using media queries.
